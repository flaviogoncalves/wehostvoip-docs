### Namespace Domains ###

The namespace will be the domain where you can create standalone tenants. You may also create tenants with verified domains. So in the example above we have created kages.wehostvoip.io. Now you may create tenants below kages.wehostvoip.io such as customer1.kages.wehostvoip.io. 

### Verified Domains ###

Sometimes it is more interesting to create the user domain. Mainly if you want to synchronize Google or Microsoft Accounts. If you have access to the DNS of a domain, you can create a verified domain. 

Don't forget to fill your address and also your currency.
