It is a beautiful interface with the objective to make the system easy and intutitive to use. PBXs are not very simple, but we tried hard to make this the simplest possible. In this interface you can create:

[Subscribers](#subscribers).
* Groups
* Phone Numbers
* Time Period
* Security Groups
* Reports
* Visual Dialplan
* Audios

Lets cover one by one of the items above
