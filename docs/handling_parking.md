## Call Parking

Call parking is a feature in a telephone system that allows a call to be placed on hold and "parked" at a designated extension, where it can be retrieved by any phone within the system. This can be useful when a call needs to be transferred to someone who is not available at the moment, or when a call needs to be transferred between two people who are not in the same location.
Call parking is a useful feature that can help improve the efficiency of a telephone system, especially in environments where people are frequently on the move or where calls need to be transferred between multiple parties.

To park a call, in the middle of the call dial \*7, the system will announce the parking extension. 

To retrieve a call from the parking lot, dial the announced extension.
