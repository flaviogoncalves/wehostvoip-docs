# Visual Dialplan #

The Visual Diaplan is one of the greatest differentiators of the system. It is simple to use and vizualize. The call will go thru node by node doing all the telephony functions such as playback, ivr and others.  

The first screen of the dialplan is to create or open it and to define timezone and timeperiod.

If you decide to create a new Visual Dialplan, fill the name, the timezone and the time period. This is very important.  Once you have selected this parameters you can start creating your Visual Dial Plan
